# AI-Learning

# Why Do This?
To learn about implementing AI learning with pythong, I followed a tutorial to implement NEAT-python Evolutionary AI to flappy bird. 
However, after the tutorial was finished, the AI only had around 3 nodes and was very basic because apparently playing flappy bird did not require a complex neural network.

# What did I add?
Well, I'm glad you asked. I wanted to experiment with a more sophisticated neural network evolution. So I decided to code in a cannon ball (cause birds have to deal with cannon balls everyday)
With this cannon ball, I had the neural network see the x and y coordinates of the ball. This added a ton of complexity. 

# What changed?
Before I added in a cannonball, after the second generation the AI would already be a flappy bird pro. However, after I added a cannonball, the Ai took 170+ generations to be able to play the game.
I didnt want to make the canonball unfair so I made it only appear at coordinates where the pipe wasn't open. The AI found that the best way to beat the game that way
was to immediately go to the next pipe opening.
