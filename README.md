# Introduction
To learn about implementing AI learning with pythong, I followed a tutorial to implement NEAT-python Evolutionary AI to flappy bird. 
However, after the tutorial was finished, the AI only had around 3 nodes and was very basic because apparently playing flappy bird did not require a complex neural network.
